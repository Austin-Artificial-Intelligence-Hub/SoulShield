# SoulShield Demo Video Script
**Target Length: 2-3 minutes**

---

## INTRO (0:00 - 0:20)

**[Show: Title card or landing page]**

> "50 million people worldwide are trapped in human trafficking. Many of them have phones — but they can't use traditional mental health apps because someone might be watching."

**[Show: About page statistics]**

> "SoulShield is a covert emotional support companion designed specifically for survivors who can't speak freely."

---

## THE PROBLEM (0:20 - 0:40)

**[Show: About page - "The Problem" section]**

> "Survivors face unique barriers:
> - Their phone may be monitored
> - They're isolated from professional help  
> - Reaching out openly could be dangerous
> 
> Existing therapy apps fail them because they use obvious clinical language that could be detected by an abuser."

---

## THE SOLUTION (0:40 - 1:20)

**[Show: Log in to the app]**

> "SoulShield looks like a simple wellness app. But under the hood, it uses a sophisticated AI system."

**[Show: How it Works page - Architecture diagram]**

> "When you send a message, our Safety Router first analyzes it for:
> - Privacy context — are you alone or is someone watching?
> - Distress level — do you need grounding?
> - Risk signals — should we prioritize safety?"

**[Type message: "He might check my phone"]**

> "Watch what happens when I indicate someone might be monitoring me."

**[Show: Response appears - neutral, bystander-safe language]**

> "The response uses neutral, everyday language. No words like 'abuse' or 'escape' — it just looks like a calming app."

---

## VOICE FEATURE (1:20 - 1:40)

**[Click voice input button]**

> "For users who can't type safely, SoulShield supports voice input."

**[Speak: "I'm feeling really anxious right now"]**

**[Enable voice replies]**

> "And voice replies — so you can use it hands-free when reading is difficult."

---

## CRISIS RESOURCES (1:40 - 1:55)

**[Click Safety Resources button in sidebar]**

> "When our system detects high distress, it gently highlights safety resources — 24/7 hotlines available via text and phone."

**[Show: Crisis modal with hotlines]**

> "We never force these — survivors stay in control."

---

## PRIVACY & SECURITY (1:55 - 2:20)

**[Show: Privacy & Security page]**

> "Privacy is paramount. SoulShield uses:
> - Client-side encryption — we can't read your messages
> - Auto-delete after 30 days
> - Zero data sharing
> - Strict content security policies to prevent attacks"

**[Toggle dark mode]**

> "And dark mode for late-night use when trauma feels heaviest."

---

## CLOSING (2:20 - 2:40)

**[Return to chat view]**

> "SoulShield is more than an app. It's a lifeline that looks ordinary — designed by trauma survivors, for trauma survivors."

**[Show: Grounding exercise in action]**

> "A calm presence, available 24/7, that keeps you safe even when someone is watching."

**[End card with logo and URL]**

> "SoulShield. Support that hides in plain sight."

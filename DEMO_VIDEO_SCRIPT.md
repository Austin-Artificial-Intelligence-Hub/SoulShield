# SoulShield Demo Video Script
**Target Length: 3 minutes**  
**Tone: Calm, serious, hopeful**

---

## OPENING HOOK (0:00 - 0:25)

**[VISUAL: Black screen → Statistics fade in one by one]**

> **NARRATOR (calm, measured voice):**  
> "50 million people are trapped in human trafficking worldwide.
> 
> 71% are women and girls.
> 
> Many of them have smartphones. They could theoretically talk to ChatGPT.
> 
> But they don't."

**[VISUAL: Fade to SoulShield logo]**

> "Because they can't trust it with their most sensitive questions."

---

## THE TRUST BARRIER (0:25 - 0:55)

**[VISUAL: Show "About" page, scroll to The Problem section]**

> **NARRATOR:**  
> "Survivors don't use ChatGPT — not because the leak risk is high, but because their trauma makes them hypersensitive to ANY privacy risk.
> 
> They need to ask things like: 'Was I drugged?', 'Is what happened to me assault?', 'I don't remember that night.'
> 
> They would never type that into a system owned by a tech company."

**[VISUAL: Show the clinical staff quote from About page]**

> "And even if they could, what happens when the AI's advice conflicts with their therapist's guidance?"

---

## THE SOLUTION (0:55 - 1:20)

**[VISUAL: Show login screen → Log in → Main chat interface appears]**

> **NARRATOR:**  
> "SoulShield solves both problems.
> 
> First: **Encryption they can actually trust.** Messages are encrypted on YOUR device — not our servers. We can't read them. No one can."

**[VISUAL: Show Privacy page → scroll to show encryption layers]**

> "Second: **Guardrails that prevent conflict.** Our AI never gives therapy advice. It only supports, grounds, and prepares survivors for their next session."

**[VISUAL: Return to chat]**

## LIVE DEMO: NORMAL SUPPORT (1:20 - 1:50)

**[VISUAL: Type in chat: "I can't stop thinking about what happened"]**

> **NARRATOR:**  
> "Let me show you how it works. I'll type: 'I can't stop thinking about what happened.'"

**[VISUAL: Show typing indicator → Response appears with grounding options]**

> "Notice the response doesn't diagnose or advise. It validates, offers grounding exercises, and asks what would help most right now.
> 
> It follows the same DBT techniques clinical staff already teach — box breathing, sensory grounding, emotion identification."

---

## LIVE DEMO: BYSTANDER MODE (1:50 - 2:30)

**[VISUAL: Click "New Session" to start fresh]**

> **NARRATOR:**  
> "Now watch what happens when someone isn't safe to talk freely."

**[VISUAL: Type: "He checks my phone every night. I just need something to help me get through today."]**

> "I'll type: 'He checks my phone every night. I just need something to help me get through today.'"

**[VISUAL: Response appears — neutral wellness language]**

> "The AI automatically detects the privacy signal. Look at the response:
> 
> No words like 'abuse,' 'escape,' or 'trafficking.' It looks like a generic wellness app.
> 
> But notice what it's really saying: 'You have the right to take care of yourself.' 'You have options.' 'Your wellbeing matters.'
> 
> To the abuser checking the phone? Just a mindfulness app. To the survivor? Affirmation of their humanity and rights."

## KEY FEATURES (2:30 - 2:50)

**[VISUAL: Quick montage showing each feature]**

> **NARRATOR:**  

**[Click voice input button, show it listening]**
> "Voice input — for users who can't safely type."

**[Enable voice replies toggle]**
> "Voice replies — so they can listen instead of reading."

**[Toggle dark mode]**
> "Dark mode — less visible at night when trauma feels heaviest."

**[Click "Safety Resources" button → Crisis modal appears]**
> "24/7 crisis hotlines — available when our system detects high distress. We never force them. Survivors stay in control."

---

## BUILT WITH LANGSMITH (2:50 - 3:05)

**[VISUAL: Optional — show LangSmith screenshot or architecture diagram]**

> **NARRATOR:**  
> "Under the hood, SoulShield uses a multi-agent AI pipeline built with LangSmith.
> 
> 4 prompts. 19 iterations. 289 test runs. 0% error rate.
> 
> We tested 39 edge cases for bystander safety — and achieved 100% safe language generation."

---

## CLOSING (3:05 - 3:20)

**[VISUAL: Return to chat → Show the tagline]**

> **NARRATOR:**  
> "Therapy happens once a week for one hour. What about the other 167 hours?
> 
> SoulShield is the AI companion survivors can actually trust — support that hides in plain sight, security they can verify, therapy they won't conflict with.
> 
> Try it now."

**[VISUAL: End card with logo + URL]**

## VOICEOVER TIPS

- **Pace**: Slightly slower than conversational — let the weight of the words land
- **Tone**: Calm, serious, but hopeful — not dramatic or sad
- **Pauses**: After statistics, after key quotes, before the solution reveal
- **Energy**: Build slightly toward the end — confidence in the solution

The video should feel like a documentary, not a product pitch. You're telling a story about a real problem and how technology can help.
